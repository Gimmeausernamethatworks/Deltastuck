# Deltastuck

This is my attempt to put Homestuck into the style of Deltarune.
So far, I only have walking, room switching, collision, a few sprites, a menu system, and a WIP dialogue system.

The controls are Arrow Keys to move, Z/Enter to select, X to sprint, X/RShift to skip to the end of dialogue, O to change outfits, and P to change player.

Hope you like it!
